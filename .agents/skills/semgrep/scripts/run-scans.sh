Usage: run-scans.sh --target DIR --output-dir DIR --mode MODE --rulesets FILE [options]

  --target DIR       absolute path to the tree to scan
  --output-dir DIR   absolute path for results; raw/ and repos/ are created under it
  --mode MODE        run-all | important-only
  --rulesets FILE    JSON: {"baseline":[...], "<language>":[...], "third_party":["https://..."]}
  --pro              add --pro to every command (Semgrep Pro engine)
  --jobs N           concurrent semgrep processes (default 4)
  --max-target-bytes N
                     skip files larger than N bytes; 0 means no limit, as it does in
                     semgrep (default 20000000). semgrep's own default is 1000000 and
                     it drops the file with no trace in the JSON
  --dry-run          print the commands that would run, then exit; clones nothing

Writes OUTPUT_DIR/scans.json:
  {scans:[{lang,ruleset,json,sarif,findings,filesScanned,partial,exitCode}],
   failed:[...], skipped:[...], unscoped:[lang], alsoShared:["lang/ruleset"],
   maxTargetBytes:N, oversized:[path]}
  partial is a scan that wrote complete output while some of its rules failed to compile.
  oversized names the files an --include glob selected that are too large for semgrep to open.

# stderr knows about is a gap the report calls coverage.
#
# Scoped to the --include globs this run actually passes, because those are the files a scan
# claimed to cover. The cross-language rulesets take no --include and semgrep decides for itself
# which files it can parse, so their share of the gap is not enumerable from here;
# references/scan-modes.md says so, and maxTargetBytes is in the report for a reader to check by
# hand. includes_for only ever emits basename patterns, which is what makes -name enough.

  # to compile while the rest of the run completes and writes complete output — e.g. 12 Java
  # rules in elttam/semgrep-rules that current semgrep cannot parse, alongside 107 that ran
  # fine, and apiiro/malicious-code-ruleset whose own log read "Scan completed successfully
  # • Findings: 51". Both were thrown away. Exit 2 also still covers a bad argument, where
  # nothing is written at all; the artifact checks below tell the two apart, so 2 is allowed
  # through and flagged partial rather than trusted outright.
  #
  # Anything outside 0/1/2 stays fatal however plausible the artifacts look, exit 7 (config
  # would not load) included. Verified on semgrep 1.173: the exit code for an unloadable
  # config depends on the OUTPUT FLAGS, which is worth knowing before trusting either number.
  # Same rules directory, same target, back to back:
  #
  #   semgrep --config rules target                              -> 7, nothing written
  #   semgrep --config rules -o out.json --sarif-output=out.sarif -> 2, nothing written
  #
  # This script uses the second form, so a config that will not load reaches here as 2 with
  # no artifacts, and the -s checks below reject it on their own. The fatal branch is
  # therefore belt-and-braces rather than the thing doing the work — but it costs nothing,
  # it is what the suite pins, and it means a future semgrep that writes an empty result set
  # alongside a hard failure cannot be read as a clean scan.
