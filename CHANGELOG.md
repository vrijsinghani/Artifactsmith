## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-09

### Added

- MCP server tools: create, status, edit, inspect, export, share, unshare, delete.
- Workspace-scoped hashed tokens with permission sets.
- HTML house-style builder. Attribution for Humanizer and frontend-design is in `NOTICE`.
- Renderers for Markdown, PDF (WeasyPrint), DOCX (python-docx), and XLSX (openpyxl).
- Shared output checks: script and URL strip, private-link and secret rejection, size and time caps.
- Compose stack with an internal object store and a mock LLM for tests. The test profile needs no API key.
- GitHub Actions: ruff, mypy, pytest with coverage, denylist, Docker build, pip-audit, Trivy, compose smokes.
- Docs: architecture, threat model, operations, formats.
- CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, issue and PR templates, Makefile, pre-commit.

### Security

- Preview origin sends no cookies and sets `script-src 'none'`.
- Compose publishes API and preview on `127.0.0.1` only.
- The process does not send usage data anywhere.
